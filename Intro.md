Most mechanical engineering systems today involve significant amounts of
electrical and electronic control systems. Effectively, most modern
mechanical engineering systems are *mechatronic* systems. Mechatronics
is the discipline that results from the synergetic application of
electrical, electronic, computer, and control engineering in mechanical
engineering systems. Thus, it is essential for the mechanical engineer
to have a strong understanding of the composition and design of
mechatronic systems, which is the goal of this course. Mechatronic
systems are around us everywhere. A car contains many mechatronic
systems, such as anti-lock braking systems, traction control, the engine
control unit and cruise control, to name a few. A satellite dish
position control unit is another example of a mechatronic system. Modern
industrial automated processes would not be possible without the
discipline of mechatronics, covering areas such as vehicle
manufacturing, pharmaceutical industries, and food processing plants.
Robotic systems are interesting and complex examples of mechatronic
systems that contain many sensors and actuators and that require very
fast and sophisticated controllers. For you, as a mechanical engineering
student, this course will represent a gateway into the world of
electrical, electronic, and control engineering. It is one of the few
courses in the mechanical engineering major that heavily relies on
electrical, electronic, and computer engineering. Being a
multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary course, your study of mechatronics
integrates and builds on a number of different courses that you have
already studied, such as mechanics, electromagnetism, measurements, and
introduction to mechanical engineering (the design project).

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  

-   Define the discipline of mechatronics.
-   Identify examples of mechatronic systems that are encountered in
    real life.
-   Identify the components of a typical mechatronic system.
-   Analyze and solve problems in simple electrical and electronic
    circuits.
-   Discuss the importance of feedback in controlling physical systems
    with the use of examples.
-   Identify and describe the different types of actuators used in
    mechatronic systems.
-   Identify and describe the different types of speed- and
    position-feedback devices.
-   Explain the principle of operation of the four types of motors: ac
    induction motor, the dc motor, the servomotor, and the stepper
    motor.
-   Size the motor for an application.
-   Select the suitable type of motor for an application.
-   Identify the signal processing that has to be applied to signals in
    mechatronic systems.
-   Identify and describe the types of controllers used in mechatronic
    systems.
-   Select the suitable type of controller for an application.
-   Explain the steps in designing a mechatronic system, and design a
    mechatronic system by following these steps.

### Course Information

Welcome to ME302. General information about this course and its
requirements can be found below.  
  
 **Course Designer:** [Dr. Lutfi
Al-Sharif](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-a-g/#DrLutfiAlSharif)  
  
 **Primary Resources:** This course comprises a range of different free,
online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the following
materials:

-   Rensselear Polytechnic Institute and Marquette University: Kevin
    Craig’s *[Multidisciplinary Mechatronic
    Innovations](http://multimechatronics.com/index.php) *(This resource
    contains many articles and videos about the discipline of
    mechatronics.)
-   Colorado State University’s [“Video Demonstrations of Mechatronic
    Devices and
    Principles”](http://video_demos.colostate.edu/mechatronics/), [“Video
    Demonstrations of
    Robotics”](http://video_demos.colostate.edu/robotics/), and [“Video
    Demonstrations from Introduction to Mechatronics and Measurement
    Systems”](http://mechatronics.colostate.edu/book/video_demos.html) (These
    webpages contain numerous videos that illustrate mechatronic
    components and mechatronic systems.)
-   All about Circuits: Tony R. Kuphaldt’s [*Volume I,
    DC*](http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_1/index.html)*;* [*Volume
    III,
    Semiconductors*](http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_3/index.html)*;*
    and *[Volume IV,
    Di­gital](http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_4/index.html) *(These
    resources contain material explaining the basics of electrical and
    electronics circuits and components.)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Unit 1 as this serves as an introduction to lay
the groundwork for understanding the more advanced, exploratory material
presented in the latter units. You will also need to complete:

-   Subunit 1.2 Activity
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all of the resources in each unit as well as the activity
listed above.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **109.5
hours** to complete. Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should
help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the
next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you 10.5 hours. Perhaps you
can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a
total of 6 hours) on Monday and Tuesday nights; subunits 1.2 through 1.4
(a total of 4.5 hours) on Tuesday night; etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** Take comprehensive notes as you work through each
resource, writing down any examples of concepts, definitions, etc. These
notes will serve as a useful review as you study and prepare for the
final exam.
