**Unit 1: Introduction to Mechatronics** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit will introduce you to the discipline of mechatronics. This is
necessary in order to allow you to understand the overall composition of
a mechatronic system and its generic components prior to delving into
the details. Upon completion of this unit, you will appreciate how
widely present mechatronic systems are in everyday life and how
important they are. You will also be able to identify the typical basic
components of a mechatronic system: the physical system being
controlled, the actuator that affects the physical system, sensors that
feedback information about the physical system, and a control system
that controls the actuator based on the feedback signal from the
feedback device.*

    [“Introduction to Mechatronics – Magnetic Levitation
    System”](http://www.multimechatronics.com/mecha_notes.php) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, scroll down to the
    title “Introduction to Mechatronics – Magnetic Levitation System,”
    and click on the title to download the PDF. You only need to read
    pages 1 to 48. Pay particular attention to the following pages: 1 to
    13, which provide an introduction to the discipline of mechatronics,
    and pages 22 to 48, which provide an introduction to how
    mechatronics is applied to problem solving in automotive
    engineering.  
      
     You will notice that the target system (physical system) to be
    controlled does not always need to be a pure mechanical system. The
    system to be controlled is sometimes referred to as the *plant*. It
    can be any of the following types of systems: mechanical
    (translational or rotational), fluidic (hydraulic or pneumatic),
    thermal, chemical, electrical, or any combination of the above.  
      
     Various authors use different definitions of mechatronics. In this
    course, the following definition shall be adopted.  
      
     *Mechatronics* is the discipline that results from the synergetic
    application of electrical, electronic, computer, and control
    engineering in mechanical engineering systems.  
      
     You will notice that the term *synergetic* has been used in the
    definition. *Synergy* is the phenomenon whereby additional results
    or benefits are achieved from the use of multiple disciplines or
    tools that are not achievable by the separate use of each of these
    disciplines or tools.  
      
     Reading this chapter should take approximately 6 hours.

**1.2 Examples of Mechatronic Systems** <span id="1.2"></span> 
*In the last subunit, you saw an example of the use of mechatronics in
automotive engineering. The following three videos introduce you to
further examples of mechatronic systems: a mobile robot, a quad-rotor,
and a printer.*

    Robotics”**

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, scroll down to the
    link titled “Raleigh, NC demonstration” under “Honda Asimo Humanoid
    Robot,” and select the link to watch the video. The quad-rotor is
    another example of the power of mechatronics and the need for fast
    control of the system to ensure stability, as you will see in this
    video. Notice how the control is initially carried out by a human
    operator but later modified to allow full automatic and autonomous
    control. It is also worth noting how disturbances are introduced
    into the system to see how the system can cope with these
    disturbances and return to the required position. It is very
    important to ensure the stability of the system, because instability
    will lead to catastrophic outcomes.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 15 minutes.

     This video shows how an inkjet printer is *dissected* to show you
    its various components. Notice the presence of actuators (i.e.,
    motors) as well as sensors (i.e., feedback devices) that are
    necessary to allow the printer to operate correctly.  
      
     You may have noticed the following from the printer video:  
      
     1. there are so many sensors and actuators that are necessary to
    make the printer work; and  
     2. translational and rotational mechanical systems are both present
    in many mechatronic systems, as can be seen in this printer.

**1.3 Components of a Mechatronic System** <span id="1.3"></span> 
*There are basically four main components of any mechatronic system.
Some mechatronic systems might contain some other components, but these
four are essential for the successful operation of a mechatronic
system:*  
  
 *1. physical system being controlled: the physical system being
controlled may be mechanical, fluidic, chemical, thermal, or
electrical;*  
 *2. actuator: the actuator provides the force or torque (or other
relevant physical input) to the physical system being controlled. In
mechanical systems, the actuator could be either translational (usually
referred to as linear) or rotational;*  
 *3. sensors: sensors are the eyes and ears of the controller. Sensors
are also referred to as transducers, although strictly speaking there
are subtle differences between sensors and transducers; and*  
 *4. controller: the controller is the brain of the mechatronic system.
It reads the input signals representing the state of the system,
compares them to the required states, and outputs signals to the
actuators to control the physical system.*

**1.4 The Multi-Disciplinary Design Process** <span id="1.4"></span> 
*By definition, a mechatronic system is a multi-disciplinary system. For
this reason, it requires a modern approach to the design process as
opposed to the classical single disciplinary design process.*

-   **Reading: Engineering and Technology Magazine: Sarah Brady’s
    “Multidisciplinary Machine Building”**
    Link: *Engineering and Technology Magazine:* Sarah Brady’s
    [“Multidisciplinary Machine
    Building”](http://eandt.theiet.org/magazine/2008/12/machine-building.cfm)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this article.
    Sarah Brady emphasizes the importance of applying the
    multi-disciplinary design process in designing mechatronic systems.
    In some cases, the design process of mechatronic systems is referred
    to as systems engineering.  
      
     From the article, you will note the following information.  
      
     1. Modern engineering systems have become very complex. This
    complexity is necessary in order to deliver the performance that we
    have come to expect of modern systems. This complexity presents
    difficulties to the designers as they have to integrate the various
    disciplines while using a parallel design process.  
     2. You have already come across the concept of synergy. Synergy is
    the phenomenon whereby a result is obtained by combining different
    components, which is greater than or unachievable by using these
    components on their own.  
     3. Reliability and quality can be achieved by applying the
    multi-disciplinary design process. Reliability and quality are very
    critical to the success of all modern engineering systems such as
    manufacturing systems, home appliances, vehicles, and aircraft.  
     4. You may have noticed the use of the term *embedded* when
    discussing controllers. This term is used to refer to a controller
    (usually a microprocessor or a microcontroller integrated circuit)
    that is located and integrated within the system to be controlled.
