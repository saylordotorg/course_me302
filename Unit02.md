**Unit 2: Electrical and Electronic Principles** <span id="2"></span> 
*This unit will review some of the electrical and electronic principles
that you have already studied and will introduce you to some new ones.
In* *[PHYS102](http://www.saylor.org/courses/phys102/) (Introduction to
Electromagnetism), you studied the three main electrical components: the
resistor, the capacitor, and the inductor. You also studied the analysis
of circuits containing these components, such as RLC circuits. In this
unit, we will revisit the operation of these components and show how
they are analogous to some of the mechanical components that you are
already familiar with (such as dampers, springs, and masses). You will
then be introduced to some simple circuits to analyze. This will be
followed by the study of electronic components such as diodes and
transistors. The last part of this unit will introduce you to digital
logic and associated electronic devices that are used to implement
digital logic. The electrical and electronic principle that you will
study in this unit are critical to building control-systems for the
mechatronic system and interfacing the controllers to the physical
system.*

**2.1 Basic Electrical Components** <span id="2.1"></span> 
*There are three basic electrical components of all electrical circuits:
resistors, capacitors, and inductors. These components are referred to
as passive components, as they do not contain a power supply. This is in
contrast with active components, such as amplifiers that require a power
supply to operate.*

    webpages in their entirety. These five readings will provide you
    with an introduction to the resistor as a component in electrical
    circuits. A resistor provides a means of resisting the flow of an
    electric current. It dissipates electrical power, converting it to
    heat.

**2.1.2 Capacitors** <span id="2.1.2"></span> 
*A capacitor acts as a storage medium for an electric charge. A
capacitor is formed as soon as two conducting plates are placed in
parallel positions. As the charge accumulates on the plates of the
capacitor, an electric field results. The material between the two
plates is important as it has an effect on the final value of the
capacitance. The capacitor stores energy in an electrical format. In
order to revise the basic concepts of capacitors, read the material
accessed via the resources linked below.*

     Instructions: Please click on the links above and read these
    webpages. A capacitor resists a sudden change in the voltage across
    its terminals. Calculus can be used to capture this in an equation
    format. On the “Factors Affecting Capacitance” webpage, note that
    capacitance is directly proportional to the area of each plate and
    the permittivity of the material between the plates and inversely
    proportional to the distance between the plates.

**2.1.3 Inductors** <span id="2.1.3"></span> 
*Inductance results when a conductor is wound a number of turns around a
former. An inductor resists the sudden change of the value of the
current flowing through it. Energy is stored in a magnetic form within
the inductor. The inductance of a coil is sometimes referred to as*
self-inductance*.*
