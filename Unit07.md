**Unit 7: Controllers** <span id="7"></span> 
*A controller is at the brain of any mechatronic system.* *The
controller reads feedback signals from the feedback devices, compares
these signals to the desired values, and then sends out signals to the
actuators that control the mechatronic system.*  
  
 *We must distinguish between the physical implementation of the
controller and the control algorithm embedded within it. The physical
implementation of the controller is the device that is used as the
controller. On the other hand, the control algorithm that is embedded
within the physical controller is the set of instructions that are used
to make the control decisions. You will study these algorithms in a
later course (*[*ME401*: *Dynamic Systems &
Controls*](http://www.saylor.org/courses/me401/)*).*  
  
 *In this unit, you will learn about the different types of physical
controllers that are used to control mechatronic systems. You will also
learn to distinguish between the physical controller that is used to
control a mechatronic system (which is the subject of this unit) and the
control algorithm that is coded within it (which is what you will learn
in* [*ME401*: *Dynamics Systems &
Controls*](http://www.saylor.org/courses/me401/)*). You will learn the
advantages and disadvantages of each type of physical controller and its
typical areas of application. You will also be able to select a suitable
type of controller for an application.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read the first
    section titled “1. Controllers” on pages 1 and 2. There are
    different types of physical controllers that can be used within
    mechatronic systems. This text discusses these different types of
    physical controllers.  
      
     Reading this chapter should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, scroll down the
    webpage to the “Mechatronic System Examples” heading, and click on
    the link to “Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) with Ladder Logic”
    to download the video. Watch the brief video. Note how the PLC is
    programmed using the ladder logic. This video shows an example of
    the use of a programmable logic controller for the control of fluid
    level.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and then watch the
    video. This video presents another widely used type of controller:
    the microcontroller. The *microcontroller* is used for applications
    that require a very compact controller that will be manufactured in
    large quantities. Note the range of applications of microcontrollers
    and the different components of a microcontroller.

     Instructions: There are a number of criteria that need to be taken
    into consideration when selecting a physical controller. These
    criteria are discussed in the following document. Please click on
    the link above and study the table on the second page as well as
    read section 2 titled “Examples,” which presents five examples on
    the selection procedure.  
      
     Reading this section should take approximately 30 minutes.
